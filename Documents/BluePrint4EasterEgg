🧩 Project: Hidden “Adventure-Style” Easter Egg

Goal

Add a secret mini-game hidden inside our main app (Node.js backend + Neo4j).
The Easter egg should be triggered by the Konami Code (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA) and open a small retro adventure game inspired by Atari Adventure.

🎮 Core Concept

Trigger: When a user enters the Konami key sequence anywhere in the app.

Result: A full-screen overlay opens containing a mini 2-D game.

Gameplay:

Player controls a small avatar (square or sprite).

Move around using arrow keys.

Find and collect a “key” object.

Bring the key to a “castle” to unlock it.

When unlocked, display a credits screen with the names or photo of the original developers.


Exit: Press ESC to close the game and return to the main app.

⚙️ Technical Blueprint

Area Specification

Frontend Language The same language the app currently uses (likely TypeScript or JavaScript). Let Cursor detect and match the framework automatically.
Game Engine Use a lightweight 2D engine like Phaser.js or an HTML5 <canvas> implementation. No external server required.
Trigger System Add a Konami code listener that dispatches a global event (e.g., open-easter-egg) when the code is entered.
Display Layer A full-screen modal or overlay <div> that hosts the game canvas. Should be dismissible.
Game Loop Simple top-down movement. Small map (≈800×600). Collision optional.
Art Assets Minimal pixel blocks or placeholder colors (player = green, key = yellow, castle = red). Later can replace with PNG sprites.
Credit Scene After the castle is opened, display text like:<br>“🏰 You found the secret! Developed by the MANFF Team (2025)”
Bundle Optimization Load Phaser or game code dynamically only after the Konami event triggers (lazy import) so it doesn’t affect main app performance.
Security No API calls or DB reads; game runs entirely client-side.
Accessibility Pause any background audio/video when the game is active.

🧠 Optional Enhancements

Add randomized key position each time.

Play an 8-bit sound when the player gets the key.

Allow touchscreen support (swipe arrows).

Store “found the Easter egg” flag in localStorage for returning users.

🧭 Prompt for Cursor

You can copy and paste this into Cursor’s chat:

> “Add a hidden Easter egg feature following this blueprint:
When a user enters the Konami code (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA), open a small retro 2D adventure game overlay.
In the game, the player moves a square avatar with arrow keys, picks up a key, opens a castle, and sees developer credits.
Use Phaser.js or HTML5 Canvas, whichever fits our project stack.
Make sure the game is lazy-loaded and can be closed with ESC. Follow the attached spec for details.”
