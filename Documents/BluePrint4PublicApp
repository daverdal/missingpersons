FULL SYSTEM BLUEPRINT: Manitoba Offender & Missing Person Alert System

🧩 Purpose

A modular system to:

1. Monitor public sources for missing persons and offender releases.


2. Store, classify, and verify alerts in Neo4j.


3. Notify subscribed clients and public users safely.


4. Provide community-sensitive features for First Nations and Indigenous communities.




---

1️⃣ Internal App (Private / Core System)

Responsibilities:

Scraping / Parsing: Pulls data from WPS, RCMP, news feeds, RSS.

Classification: Tags events as Missing Person, Offender Release, or News Alert.

Storage: Inserts nodes and relationships in Neo4j.

Verification: Admin dashboard for verifying alerts, flagging incorrect info.

Notification Trigger: Sends SMS via Twilio or push notifications (to internal or public subscribers).

Admin Controls: Full access to historical alerts, trends, and audit logs.


Neo4j Schema (Core + Community Enhancements):

(:Agency { name, url })
(:Event { type, date, source_url, verified, content_level })
(:Person { name, age, community, status })
(:Community { name, region, type })
(:User { phone, preferences, community_subscribed })
(:Service { name, url, type })

Relationships:
(Agency)-[:REPORTED]->(Event)
(Event)-[:INVOLVES]->(Person)
(Event)-[:RELEVANT_TO]->(Community)
(User)-[:SUBSCRIBED_TO]->(Community)
(Alert)-[:SOURCE]->(Service)


---

2️⃣ Community-Sensitive Enhancements

Community Filtering: Alerts sent only to relevant regions/communities.

Content Sensitivity: Options for full/high-level alert details; disclaimers for incomplete info.

Privacy & Security: Encrypted user data, opt-in/opt-out controls.

Verification: Flagging and approval by community coordinators.

Accessibility: SMS for low-internet users, optional push notifications.

Optional Cultural Features: Community notice board, Indigenous language messages, support service links.



---

3️⃣ Public App (Community-Facing)

Responsibilities:

Subscriptions for community members.

Receives filtered and sanitized alerts via secure endpoints from the internal app.

Sends SMS / push notifications to subscribers.

Displays only community-relevant data; no sensitive info exposed.


Flow:

User subscribes → Requests alerts → Internal App API filters & sanitizes → Alerts delivered via SMS / Push


---

4️⃣ Client/Internal App (Hybrid for Coordinators)

Internal clients access the full alert system.

Can verify alerts, manage communities, view trends.

Uses same internal endpoints with full permissions.



---

5️⃣ Communication via Secure Endpoints

Public app consumes only filtered data from internal app endpoints.

Protects the database from direct access.

Enables authentication, rate-limiting, logging, and auditing.

6️⃣ Modular File Structure Recommendation

modules/
├─ alerts/
│ ├─ scraper.js # fetch & parse feeds
│ ├─ classifier.js # classify events
│ ├─ storage.js # Neo4j interactions
│ ├─ notifier.js # SMS / push notifications
│ ├─ filters.js # community & content filters
│ └─ config.js # feed URLs, keywords, community list
server.js # main app imports modules

8️⃣ Future Enhancements

NLP to detect Indigenous names or communities automatically.

Multi-language alerts (Indigenous languages).

Historical dashboards showing trends by community or region.

Integration with local liaison officers for faster verification.

This full blueprint covers the entire system: core scraping & notifications, community-sensitive logic, and separation between internal and public apps.

It’s ready for Cursor AI or your dev team to generate the modules.


---

If you want, I can also make a condensed “Cursor-ready prompt” version of this full blueprint that you could paste directly into Cursor to generate the entire system. This would combine Part 1, Part 2, and the public/internal architecture into one prompt.
